# bayesian_linear_fit


Author: Oscar Javier Hernandez


The purpose of this repository is to fit a linear model to a set of data points {(x,y)} using Bayesian statistics. The mathematical details are contained in the jupyter note book [program_link](https://github.com/OscarJHernandez/bayesian_linear_fit/blob/master/Bayesian%20Linear%20Fitting.ipynb)

Markov Chain Monte Carlo is used to sample the proability distribution likelyhoods.
